  <h1><a href="https://www.espn.com/">ESPN</a></h1>
  <p>The first website I will be taking a  deeper dive into will be ESPN. I personally use this website and mobile app a lot so I wanted to choose something that I use on a daily basis. To begin with, I really like this website mostly because of the layout. Across the top there are live scores of games that have drop menus that allow the user to access the box score or watch live with ESPN+. Also, ESPN covers a lot of information within the sports world covering numerous sporting events. The center column is links containing images of headlines of game scores. Between these articles, which I did not know, a user can customize their ESPN homepage by following specific sports teams. This website also contains a lot of links, and I mean A LOT! Along the right side column there are several links to highlighted articles. The left hand column presents the user with multiple options on how to keep up with ESPN including; other apps that contain ESPN, social media outlets and subcategories under ESPN. The three column outline maintains a clean and presentable format with drop down icons across the top including individual sports. I really like that there are no pop-out icons that expand when hovering as there is a lot going on and would clutter the page by doing so. I like that this website is very simple. There are three colors: red within the logo, grey and a great use of a white background with thinly lined borders around links. This page contains a lot of links containing endless information and does a very good job of presenting the material. Rounded corners around the boxes also present the information in a more spacious way.</p>

  <h1><a href="https://www.freestoneflyshop.com/">Freestone</a></h1>
  <p>Next on the list is Freestone Fly shops website. I had to do this because one I work for them primarily and two I am presented on the website! I really like the format of this website as a whole. First off there is a drop down menu across the header that presents only the necessary items of a fly shop (guided trips, river reports, contact information and the rivers the shop fishes). The first image that catches the user's eye is a dark image with bold white letters that gives hope to a new fisherman that the Bitterroot is the place to fish as it is the dry fly capital of the country. Below that is a promotion that engages the users with a picture of the shop and the products within. My favorite part is the section following. It was cool to see the overlapping boxes with wrapping text that we use in class (indicating modern HTML5 elements). This is my favorite section due to the links and images provided. It goes more in depth with the shop, customer experiences and direct quotes from said customers. Here there are links to booking guided trips and the guides of the shop (where you can hire yours truly if you really desire). The formatt of the images of guides holding fish with customers with their quoted opinions was an excellent idea! Lastly, the fact that all of the contact information is presented through links and direct text boxes is crucial. I find this very necessary as customers are going to need to find the shop and contact them to book a guided trip. Along with this, the colors of the page tie nicely into the outdoor atmosphere. There are a lot of natural colors with white and black text that grabs the user's eye.</p>

  <h1><a href="https://montana.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a></h1>
  <p>I am very glad we had the opportunity to review a poorly made website. This is my least favorite website and it has been for a very long time. I go on craigslist a lot looking for snowmobiles or drift boats and it seems to be a hassle no matter the occasion. To begin with, the formatting is atrocious. Maybe the ugliest website there is. I really dislike the pure white with the purple linked icons. Also, navigation within the website is even worse. First the user must declare a location. From that point they are presented with a list of several categories (this is where it gets bad). For example, if I were to enter the Helelan craigslist under boats for sale I would see every single boat available. Next I would have to search the desired make or model of the boat. Within the  updated search there are many options for nearby locations. In my opinion there should be a radius used much like Facebook MarketPlace. This is where the website falls apart. A user can search several different key words and get different results of the same item depending on the words used. I've looked up drift boats, very broad, and only three come up. I then search “RO” (which is a drift boat company) and seven RO drift boats will come up that were not on the page when “drift boat” was searched. I think there are several flaws within the searching system and find the website to be very out of date, hard to navigate and a mixing pot of mixed information.</p>
