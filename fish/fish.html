    <p>Trout are a fresh water species that thrive within the rivers of Montana. The state contains nine trout rivers which stretch nearly 169,829 miles.</p>
    <p>There are several species of trout that call the rivers of Montana home. Trout provide an opportunity for outdoor activities and also provide a reliable source of food. A 2 ounce filet contains several amino acids and loads of protien.</p>
    <p>Not a lot of people target fish for food. Many anglers hit the river to catch trout out of pure enjoyment through fly fishing. A majority of a fish's diet is consumed below the surface of the water; however, many anglers can trick fish into surfacing and eating a fly of choice on the top of the water. This was what fly fisherman live for.</p>
