  <h1>Ranking of States Websites</h1>

  <h1><a href="https://www.maryland.gov/">Maryland</a></h1>
  <p>Maryland's state website was the most impressive wesbite to me primarily due to the organization, attention grabbing mechanisms and efficiency. As a user enters the website the entire site loads very promptly. Along the top of the site there is
    the typical horizontal menu with drop down icons; however, I liked how these icons were spaced out and easy on the eye. Of course, like many state websites, there was a designed link that catches the users attention immediatly that obtains
    information regarding covid-19. Below the menu there is a bar that toggles allowing the user to access frequently used links and resources. Also, the feature that impressed me was the design that grabs the attention of the user. The font turns
    from black with a white background to the near opposite contrast of white font and a red background. This really stood out and was useful because the links within the segment was frequently searched through online servers. This was interesting
    that the states website went out of it's way to provide commonly searched questions and information within the state of Maine. Also, there was a list of news letters, upcoming events and public informational events that anyone can attend.
    Overall, this was the most navigational website with the highest efficiency for what was presented.</p>

  <h1><a href="https://www.maine.gov/">Maine</a></h1>
  <p>The Maine website was pretty simplistic and got the job done. It was very plain to the eye and the center of attention was taken to the background image. The one main feature that I really liked abou this website was that within the menu there
    was not drop down icons rather links to differant pages within the same browser. I thought this was a very efficient way of presenting data to all levels of technological users. Also, within the middle of the website there was three large icons
    that presented thre options: get notified, your government and your governor. This was one of the least appealing elements. I felt this was in the way and was not a useful way to advance the users down the page. However, the best part of the
    website was located at the bottom. There was a map that allowed users to locate any location that would be presented through google maps including; grocery stores, government buildings and public areas. Also, I found the moving image wtihin the
    site very facinating and inviting. Within the image there was several links to popular activities within the State.</p>

  <h1><a href="https://portal.arkansas.gov/">Arkansas</a></h1>
  <p>The Arkansas website is very efficient. As the user enteres the page the first thing that comes to mind is plain and simple; however, there is an ubundance of information within the site. The first options that arise are the main services that
    have been used by a majority of users. This includes hunting and fishing licenses, laws on parrol payments(kinda sketchy to me) and "all services" The one thing that stood out to me was there was moving objects. As the user scrolls over
    selectable options, images appear and the selector becomes larger. Scrolling farther down on the page I found it interesting that many of the officials working within the states were listed with social media attatched. Finally, at the bottom of
    the page there was a small calender of upcoming events and news within the state. The website adjusted well, but the colors within the background were not the most appealing. At the very top of the website there was two layers of menu lists. I
    felt that there was an unnecessary amount of information. This could become difficult for users unformiliar with technological servers. </p>

  <h1><a href="https://portal.kansas.gov/">Kansas</a></h1>
  <p>The Kansas state homepage is very unusual one would say. The website suprised me personally to say the least. As the user enteres the website there is an enlargered blinking search bar that appears. The background of the website is a black
    history mural that is located within padding. There is no menu or icons within the website. The only words are located accross the top linking users to a source regarding covid within the state. However, within the search bar, as words are typed
    there are several options that pop up based on the words typed within the search bar. This keeps a very clean and user friendly website. The website does adjust based on screen size whcih would be extremely helpful for users on the phone.
    Overall, the wesbite is very simple, modern and efficient. The website as a whole models Google. I feel that a wesbite should have more visible options and menues that allows a visual aid to navigate within the site.</p>

  <h1><a href="https://www.alaska.gov">Alaska</a></h1>
  <p>The Alaska state home page needs alot of work in my opinion. Upon entering the web page, the user can easily tell that it is quite plain and could use a renovation. On first glance, the page does not take up the whole page and has rounded
    edges that makes the web page look sloppy and unprofessional. Additonally, nothing on the page really stands out or grabs the users attention. It is extemely bland and does not have selectors that stand out, everything seems to run together. The
    final issue with the page is that it does not resize properly when adjusting the screen. When attmepting to access the size through a phone for example, the site stays in the same format for a while, then eventually does not respond well. The
    website then sends adds moving the screen side to side while at the same time makes the user slide the bar at the bottom to navagate the page. However, not all of the web page is bad. To contrast all the negative appearance, the site is quite
    easy to access and is very simplistic. It provides a very easy path for Alaskian citizens to find a job, obtain a hunting license, or register themselves to vote. For a person with lesser technical skills, this webstie would be very user
    friendly. Lastly, it is laid out in a formal format that does not restrict the states identity.</p>
